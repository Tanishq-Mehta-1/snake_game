Recently, I had been learning c++ from learncpp.com, but was looking to make a project in cpp, to get some hands-on experience with it. 
I chanced upon this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-lMZDi7Uw) by NVitanovic, and it made me realise how doable this was for me.
And so, i recreated the game in cpp.

I have watched the tutorials (all 3), but have coded it all by myself, even implementing more features, some different implementations
Features of Game / Learnings: 
-Made a console app that redraws console every frame => removed the flickering by adding ASCII return codes [could maybe draw it all to a buffer and then cout that buffer at once?]
-handling inputs of user
-using time delays and thread delays to simulate speed increases
-using data structures for development

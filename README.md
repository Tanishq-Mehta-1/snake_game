<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Recently, I had been learning c++ from learncpp.com, but was looking to make a project in cpp, to get some hands-on experience with it. 
I chanced upon this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-lMZDi7Uw) by NVitanovic, and it made me realise how doable this was for me.
And so, i recreated the game in cpp.
I had watched the tutorials (all 3), but have coded it all by myself, even implementing more features, some different implementations.</p>
<h2>Features of Game: </h2>
<br>-Made a console app that redraws console every frame => removed the flickering by adding ASCII return codes [could maybe draw it all to a buffer and then cout that buffer at once?]</br>
<br>-handling inputs of user</br>
<br>-using time delays and thread delays to simulate speed increases</br>
<br>-using data structures for development</br>
